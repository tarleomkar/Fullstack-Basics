# Fullstack-Basics
Connecting Frontend to Backend with Axios 🌐

Overview 📖

In this project, I learned the basics of connecting a frontend to a backend using:

Axios for making HTTP requests

Core concepts of API communication

Setting up a proxy to handle requests effectively

Features 🚀

Dynamic Data Rendering: Displayed 5 jokes fetched from the backend API.

API Integration: Used axios to fetch data from a locally hosted backend server.

Proxy Setup: Simplified API calls using a proxy configuration to avoid CORS issues.

Tech Stack 🛠️

Frontend: React

Backend: Express (for the jokes API)

HTTP Client: Axios

Steps to Run the Project 🏃‍♂️

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd <project-folder>

Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

# For the frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# For the backend
cd ../backend
npm install

Start the backend server:

cd backend
npm start

Start the frontend server:

cd frontend
npm run dev

Open the application in your browser:

http://localhost:3000

Example Output 🎉
